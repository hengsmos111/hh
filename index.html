              The Angkor Wat archeological complex is located around 5km (3
              miles) from Siem Reap, and you can’t reach it by foot (I mean you
              can, but it would be very unpleasant and would waste a ton of
              time). You can hire a bike which I wouldn’t recommend unless
              you’re a big bike enthusiast (distances between the temples are
              significant, and Cambodia is hot and dusty) or hire a tuk-tuk
              driver.
              <br /><br />
              Tuk-tuks are the most popular way to explore the Angkor temples.
              They cost around 20-30 USD per day and can be found everywhere in
              Siem Reap. Keep reading to see how to get yourself a top-notch
              tuk-tuk driver.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to see Angkor Wat would not lead you around all 50
              temples. I mean, if you’re a huge history buff, you can get the
              7-day pass and try to do it, but for the regular visitor, so many
              temples would be too much. <br />
              I suggest visiting around ten temples in 3 days. <br /><br />
              Once you have a tuk-tuk driver, they would offer you three
              different routes – Small Circle (Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Keo
              and Ta Prohm), Big Circle (Preah Khan, Neak Pean, Ta Som and Pre
              Rup) and the Long Trip ( Women’s Temple , Landmine Museum and
              other small temples outside the main park). <br /><br />
              For your three days, my best suggestion is skipping the Long Trip
              and focus on the other two. To escape the crowds and have the best
              experience possible, we’re going to tweak them a little bit.
              <br /><br />

            <p>
              Angkor Wat is an architectural masterpiece and the largest
              religious monument in the world covering an area four times the
              size of Vatican City. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman
              II in the first half of the 12th century, around the year
              1110-1150, making Angkor Wat almost 900 years old. <br /><br />
              The temple complex, built in the capital of the Khmer Empire, took
              approximately 30 years to build. It was originally dedicated to
              the Hindu god Vishnu before becoming a Buddhist temple by the end
              of the 12th century.
